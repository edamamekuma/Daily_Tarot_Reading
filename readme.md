## Description
This project is written in Python to draw one or three randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 78 descriptions and image references.  
  
There are two mode of reading, single card and three-card. The text results from both modes will show on the terminal.  
  
The single card tarot is used to provide a concise reading, keeping the focus succinct and to the point. This type of reading can be helpful when requiring a more defined answer.  
  
In the three-card spread, the first card pulled represents the past, the second represents the present, and the third represents the future.  
  
  
### Notes
> This was my first Python project from the basic programming lecture at Kyushu University back in 2023, giving me the opportunity to access coding and programming from the very beginning.  
>  
> Low-key thanks to Dr. Ito and Dr. Seki, both from the lecture, whose guidance and passion for programming made all the difference, sparking my curiosity and inspiring me to dive deeper into the world of coding.  
>   
> I immiedily fell in love with the beauty of coding. There was something mesmerizing about how each line of code flowed, solving problems in such a clean and elegant way. With every new challenge, I felt a rush of excitement, eager to uncover how the next piece of the puzzle would fit.
